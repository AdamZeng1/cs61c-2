# CS61C - Great Ideas in Computer Architecture

My coursework for [CS61C Spring 2015](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/sp15/).

Lectures, at the time of writing, are available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-XXv-cvA_iCl2-D-FS5mk0jFF6cYSJs_).

The subjects covered in this course include: C and assembly language programming, how higher level programs are translated into machine language, computer organization, caches, performance measurement, parallelism, CPU design, warehouse-scale computing, and related topics. The only prerequisite is that you have taken CS61B, or at least have solid experience with a C-based programming language.
